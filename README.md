# drawAvirus
DrawAvirus is a tool to draw virus genomes with open reading frames (ORF).

DrawAvirus will produce virus genome organisation schemes where a line represents the virus genome and squares ORFs. Alignment of the ORFs either above, on, or below the genome line depicts the reading frame of the ORF. ORFs can be named and coloured. Additional information, such as, poly-adenine sequence or terminal repeats, can be inserted on a 5' and 3' ends.
